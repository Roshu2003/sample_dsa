# DSA_Dojo

DSA Dojo is designed to enhance users' proficiency in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through a diverse range of questions categorized into three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard.

Easy Category: This section is tailored for beginners and those looking to reinforce fundamental concepts. It consists of a curated collection of straightforward DSA problems that cover basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and simple algorithms like searching and sorting. The easy category aims to provide users with a gentle introduction to problem-solving techniques and algorithmic thinking.

Medium Category: The medium section serves as a bridge between foundational knowledge and more advanced concepts. It presents users with challenges that require a deeper understanding of various data structures and algorithms. Problems in this category may involve more complex scenarios, such as tree traversal, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and more intricate sorting and searching techniques.

Hard Category: Reserved for seasoned practitioners and advanced learners, the hard category offers a formidable array of challenging problems that push the boundaries of problem-solving skills. These problems often demand innovative approaches, optimization techniques, and a comprehensive understanding of advanced data structures and algorithms. Topics covered may include advanced graph algorithms, segment trees, advanced dynamic programming, and combinatorial optimization, among others.
